# Code Quiz

**Guidelines:**

* The user arrives at the landing page and is presented with a call-to-action to "Start Quiz." Also note the navigation option to "View Highscores" and the "Time" value set at 0.

* Clicking the "Start Quiz" button presents the user with a series of questions. The timer is initialized with a value and immediately begins countdown.

* Score is calculated by time remaining. Answering quickly and correctly results in a higher score. Answering incorrectly results in a time penalty (for example, 15 seconds are subtracted from time remaining).

* When time runs out and/or all questions are answered, the user is presented with their final score and asked to enter their initials. Their final score and initials are then stored in localStorage.

* Your application should also be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

* Refer to the animated GIF below for a demonstration of the application functionality.

**Minimum Requirements**

* Functional, deployed application.

* GitHub repository with README describing project.

* The first view of the application displays a button that starts the quiz.

* Clicking the start button displays a series of questions.

* Once the quiz begins, a timer starts.

* If a question is answered incorrectly, additional time is subtracted from the timer.

* The timer stops when all questions have been answered or the timer reaches 0.

* After the game ends, the user can save their initials and score to a highscores view using local storage.

**Bonus**

* Add audio files to alert the user of correct or incorrect answers. Be sure to include the appropriate license.

* Customize the application theme.

* Create multiple quizzes and an option for users to choose between them.

* Add the application to your portfolio.
